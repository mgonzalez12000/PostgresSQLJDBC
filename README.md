# PostgresSQLJDBC_MusicLabelApplication
A JDBC application that stores information about musicians and the company. The JDBC client's goal is to provide a user who is not experienced with SQL to interact with the database. JDBC application does not use real data from real musicians. All data is mock data for learning and implementation purposes.

Please see repo for ER Diagram, ER Schema, DDL SQL, Procedures/Triggers, and Java client source code.
